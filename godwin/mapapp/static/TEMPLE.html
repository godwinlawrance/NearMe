Arulmigu Bala Murugan Temple inside Saveetha campus is a prominent shrine dedicated to Lord Muruga, located at Thandalam within 
the Saveetha Medical College and University premises near Chennai. The temple is famous for its towering 40 foot monolithic granite statue
of Bala Murugan, weighing around 150 tonnes and regarded as one of the tallest stone Murugan icons in the world. The idol stands on a 
star shaped pedestal (shatkona) with a meditation hall beneath, symbolising peace and spiritual elevation for devotees and students. 
The temple complex is artistically laid out, and from above it is designed to resemble the sacred syllable Om, adding deeper 
spiritual significance to the site. Situated just off the Chennai to Bengaluru highway, it has also become a popular devotional and 
tourist attraction for visitors from Chennai and beyond.
